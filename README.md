**About**

Based on the blog post from <a href= "http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/10/how-to-make-millions-with-idea-sex/"> How To Make Millions with Idea Sex by James Altucher</a> combosex.py is a massive text file I scraped from various sources combining English nouns, adverbs, adjectives, verbs and random words. Printing out 10 entries per run, however that can be changed easily by formatting the while loop.

*(change 10 to desired out)*

**Uses**
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the folder
3. Run python3 combosex.py (optionally > or >> to a file)

**Scaling**

In its current use, it is fine for what I use it for, breaking creative blocks. I put this together in 10 minutes of so after spending a few hours compiling all the data sources.

In the future, I will be adding more values and may give me a reason to this behind a GUI and host it with a python web development framework. This is merely a starting point.

**Re-Use**
